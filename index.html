			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.” <br>
				—Eleanor Roosevelt

			<p>My name is Ryan Abreu. I am an experience orientated individual at my core. My goal in life is to provide the people in my life
			with an experience that betters their lives in some aspect. <br> I have found that being a full-stack developer
			is the most effective method for me to achieve this, because it combines my passion and interest in art and technology
			with being able to lead someone through an experience.
			I hope to refine my abilities to create visually stimulating content that engages the user and holds their attention
			while I take them on the journey through the experience that I am hoping to provide them. <br>
			I enjoy thinking about how users perceive information, relate the information to themselves and walk away with ideas
		that improve their lives in some aspect. </p>

							<h3>Fridays On The Plaza</h3>
							<p>I was looking at the promotional work that our local library put up
							for the Friday On The Plaza event in Cheyenne and I found it to be boring, and didn't really provide
						a sense of energy about It. <br> My good friend Bobby Phillips is performing in the event and I felt that he
					 deserved a more thought out promotional poster that wasn't nearly as cluttered as the one commissioned for the event.
					 <br>
					 I took an image from Bobbys' facebook page, increased the contrast of the image and carefully created vector shapes
					  from the shadows provided by the up in contrast. <br> I was quite pleased with the result!

							<h3>Seamore Eye Guy</h3>
							<p>This little guy was one of my challenges that I did for The Array School of Technology And Design. <br>
							 We had to create a realistic image of something using only vector shapes in Sketch.
						 		<br> I was trying to find a use for the pencil tool in Sketch as there seemed to be very little use
							 for it in designing. However, I found using the pencil tool and applying a fill to the path I created <br>
						  made for an excellent texture that I was looking for in the Iris!</p>

							<h3>Login Mockup</h3>
							<p>The students at array were tasked with designing a login page for an application.
							 I decided to go for a short and simple page that creates a sense of adventure within itself. <br>
						 the jagged edges of the banner not only adds to the sense of adventure, but are also reminiscent of mountains.
					 		<br>The challenge of designing something with the mindset of having to create it afterwords really made me
						 think about how to make it simple yet visually striking.</p>

							<h3>Wasabi Grill & Bar</h3>
							<p>I was approached by Wasabi Grill & Bar to do a redesign of their website. <br>
							Their previous website was created poorly and the images used were rushed. (top image)
							<br> I took their current logo and made them a custom vector image of their logo so the
						 issue that that had in the past would not be repeated. <br>
					 	I also took into account that Wasabi was not some fast food resturant and their current logo did not represent the elegance and
					feel of thier actual resturant. <br>I recomended the use of the new color schemes for thier logo to better represent that.</p>
