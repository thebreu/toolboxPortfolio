	<!--Now that the navigation is created we should work on the main part of the website in a
	main class. this is important for screen readers, as it will not read out anything outside the main
	to the user. so in the case that we added some navigation to our navigation div, it wond sit there reading off 	       nonsense to the users -->

		<!-- What do we want our potential employers or users to see on this webpage?
			what is most important to the users of this site?
			I would imagine an employer or user would want to know more about who I am.
			so that is a good start i think.
			We will start with a welcoming page that greets the user and gives a brief
			description as to what the site is all about.-->

			<h2>Ryan Abreu</h2>
			<blockquote>
				“The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience.” <br>
				—Eleanor Roosevelt
			</blockquote>
			<p>I am an experience orientented individual at my core. My goal in life is to provide the people in my life
			with an experience that betters their lives in some aspect <br> I have found that being a full-stack developer
			is the most effective method for me to achieve this because it combines my passion and interest in art and technology
			with being able to lead someone through an experience.
			I hope to refine my abilities to create visually stimulating content that engages the user and holds their attention
			while I take them on the journey through the experience that I am hoping to provide them. <br>
			I enjoy thinking about how users percieve information, relate the information to themselves and walk away with ideas
		that improves their lives in some aspect. </p>

			creating each indevidual piece, that doesnt take away from the users ability to view the piece itself. -->
